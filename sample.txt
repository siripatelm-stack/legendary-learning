Hey there i am siri , trying to learn about Github 
1. trying to learn about building projects
2. exploring deployment.
also API and Keploy .
still don't know what it means .
always wasting time , not scheduling time .


from now onwards , i spend atleast 45 minutes in knowing about open source and 
also another 45 mins for GitHub contribution
